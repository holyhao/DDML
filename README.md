# DDML
- The algorithm used here is a simplified version of the one used in our paper [Diversity regularized metric learning for person re-identification,IEEE International Conference on Image Processing,2016](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7533164/) .

## Framework
- Matlab

## Hardware
- IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-5700 CPU
- Memory 16G
- Operate system Windows7

## Data
- Features of training data [train_fea.mat]().
- Similar pairs [train_simi_pairs.txt](),each line is a data pair labeled as similar.
- dissimilar pairs [train_diff_pairs.txt](),each line is a data pair labeled as dissimilar.

## Code
- main script [dml.m]().
